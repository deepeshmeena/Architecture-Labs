<ol>
	<li><p>Using a gcc cross-compiler to generate MIPS assembly code</p>
	</li><li><p>Using the SPIM simulator to do instruction execution counts</p>
	</li><li><p>Answering performance related questions using measurements</p>

<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Instructions</font></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p>These exercises are to be done individually.</p>
	</li><li><p>While you are encouraged to discuss with your colleagues, do
	not cross the fine line between discussion <i>to understand</i>
	versus discussion as a <i>short-cut</i> to complete your lab without
	really understanding.</p>
	</li><li><p>Create a directory called &lt;rollno&gt;-&lt;labno&gt;. Store
	all relevant files to this lab in that directory.</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>In the exercises, you will be asked various questions. Note
		down the answers to these in a file called “lab04-answers.txt”.</p>
		</li><li><p>In some parts of the exercises, you will have to show a demo
		to a TA; these are marked as such. The evaluation for each lab will
		be in the subsequent lab, or during a time-slot agreed upon with
		the TAs. For this evaluation, you need to upload your code as well.</p>
		</li><li><p>While submitting (on BodhiTree), you have to create a tar.gz
		or zip of the entire &lt;rollno&gt;-&lt;labno&gt; directory in
		which all your relevant files reside.</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li><p>Before leaving the lab, ensure the following:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>You have signed the attendance sheet</p>
		</li><li><p>You have uploaded your submission</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li><p>Things to ensure during TA evaluation of a particular lab
	submission:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>The TA has looked at your text file with the answers to
		various questions</p>
		</li><li><p>The TA has given you marks out of 10, and has entered it in
		the marks sheet, with his/her signature</p>
		</li><li><p>You have counter-signed the above-mentioned marks</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li><p>You have to use the MIPS conventions, unless mentioned
	otherwise.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>House points:</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">Some
	questions carry house points. For these, you are allowed to work
	along with others, but only if </span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">all</span></i>
	<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">of
	those working together have completed the lab and shown it to the
	TA. (You can work on it individually, even before finishing the lab
	completely, but only if you care about house points more than your
	own marks!). All questions related to house points have to be shown
	to the instructor (Bhaskar).</span></span></span></p>

<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Getting
warmed up with the cross compiler</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Question
	[1 mark]:</b> What is a cross-compiler? What is the <i>host</i>
	platform? What is the <i>target</i> platform? You can use the
	Internet to learn these.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">A gcc
	cross-compiler for the MIPS target machine has been compiled (yes,
	the compiler itself was compiled) and made available to you. You
	should see it in the folder /opt/mips-cross/bin in the NSL machines.
	<i>Note: gcc stands for GNU C Compiler.</i></p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Add the
	folder /opt/mips-cross/bin to your PATH environment variable.</p>
	</li><li><p><i>Important note: you should not use any C or C++ library
	routines, including I/O routines. The MIPS cross compiler available
	in the NSL lab does not have support for these.</i></p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Download the
	gcd.c code given in moodle. Make sure you understand the logic.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Compile the
	above program using the cross compiler mips-linux-gcc, using the
	“-S” option. The “-S” option specifies that the output of
	the compiler should be assembly code. You should now have “gcd.s”.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The assembly
	code in “gcd.s” needs a few modifications before it can be run
	on spim or xspim.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">There are a
		few assembler directives which spim/xspim do not understand. Use
		the program “remove_asm_directives.pl”, available on moodle, to
		remove these. Call the new file as “gcd-noopt.s”.</p>
		</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>GCC
		labeling convention [5 house points]:</b> Find out what the gcc
		convention is for making labels; if you are the among the <b>first</b>
		to find out and tell me, you will get <span style="font-weight: normal">5
		house points.</span></p>
		</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
		You should also define “result” in the data segment. And also
		define the “syscall_print” procedure. You can use the
		“asmutils.s” file for these. You can load the files
		“asmutils.s” and “gcd-noopt.s” one after another in xspim
		or qtspim.</p>
	</li></ul>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Demo to
	TA [1 mark]:</b> You should now be able to load the program on spim
	or xspim and run it. Run it and show a demo to the TA.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Demo to
	TA [1 mark]:</b> Comment the gcd-noopt.s assembly code. Specifically
	comment on the various parts of the stack frame for the gcd function
	(there may be some parts of the frame which you cannot identify,
	that is ok). Show the code with the comments to the TA.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Complete
	frame identification [Upto 5 house points]:</b> If you can identify
	the entire frame convention (perhaps by using other example
	programs), you will get 5 house points.</p>
</li></ul>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Getting
the instruction execution count</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Demo to TA [1 mark]:</b> Learn to use “spim” (not
	xspim or qtspim) from the command-line, and to give commands to make
	it run “gcd-noopt.s”. Show a demo of this to the TA.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Demo to TA [1 mark]:</b> You can get spim to print each
	executed instruction by using “step” with a numeric argument.
	From this output of the spim execution above, get the exact
	instruction execution count for <i>your</i> <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">program
	(there may be a few instructions before and after </span></span><i>your</i>
	<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">program,
	be sure to not count these).</span></span></p>
	</li><li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Script
	to get instruction count [upto 5 house points]:</b></span></span><span style="font-variant: normal">
	</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Manually
	counting the lines from spim's output can be painful. Use the
	“script” command to automatically copy all printed stuff on the
	screen to a file (don't use cut-paste from screen, that's a bit
	painful too). Then write a bash script (python or perl would be an
	overkill) to count the required number of executed instructions.</span></span></p>
</li></ul>
<h3 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; page-break-after: avoid">
<font color="#0000ff">GCC compiler optimization</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">When you
	look at the compiler generated assembly code, it is obvious that it
	is inefficient. But it is not so bad as it seems. The compiler has
	many optimization options. (You can read about these by using “man
	gcc” if you are interested).</p>
	</li><li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Now
	compile gcd.c using the “-O1” option; this specifies
	optimization level-1. You will also have to use the
	“-fno-delayed-branch” option. As earlier, use
	</span></span>“<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">remove_asm_directives.pl”
	and “asmutils.s”, to generate an assembly file ready for
	execution in SPIM. Call this new assembly file “gcd-opt.s”.</span></span></p>
	</li><li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Demo
	to TA [1 mark]:</b></span></span> <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Show
	that this new optimized version works correctly. Also show
	“gcd-opt.s” with your appropriate comments added.</span></span></p>
	</li><li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Question
	[1 mark]:</b></span></span> <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Compute
	the instruction execution count for “gcd-opt.s”. How much faster
	is it compared to “gcd-noopt.s”?</span></span></p>
	</li><li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Delayed
	branches [Upto 5 house points]:</b></span></span> Now compile gcd.c
	with the -O1 option, but without the “-fno-delayed-branch”
	option. This<span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">results
	in uncovering an optimization feature called </span></span><i>delayed
	branches</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
	Learn at a high level, what delayed branches are (we will learn them
	in detail anyway later in the course). Observe the use of the
	delayed branch option. Now by default, the simulation will NOT work
	correctly. Observe this. Can you use an appropriate SPIM
	command-line option to execute your code correctly? (I couldn't
	quite make it work correctly).</span></span></p>
	</li><li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Higher

	<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Understand

<font color="#0000ff">Answering performance related questions</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">This
	exercise will give a preview into the advantage of a multi-cycle
	implementation.  We now want to use the simulator to compare the
	performance of a single cycle implementation with a multi-cycle
	implementation of the MIPS ISA. Assume that a multi-cycle
	implementation uses a clock which is 5 times faster than a single
	cycle implementation. Also assume that in a multi-cycle
	implementation, the number of cycles taken for lw is 5, for sw is 4,
	for all types of branch instructions is 3, and for all other
	instructions is 4.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Write a
	python script (or in any other language, preferably scripting
	language), which takes the sequence of executed instructions output
	by using the “step” command in spim in an input file, and
	computes the number of cycles taken by the MIPS program. The script
	should compute both (a) the number of cycles taken in a single cycle
	implementation, as well as (b) the number of cycles taken in a
	multi-cycle implementation. The script should print these cycle
	counts, and also how much faster a multi-cycle implementation is
	compared to a single cycle implementation.</p>
