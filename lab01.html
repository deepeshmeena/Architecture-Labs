<h1><font color="#800000">CS341, Computer Architecture Lab, Lab 01</font></h1>
<h3 class="western"><font color="#0000ff">Goals</font></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p>Learn the basics of spim/xspim/qtspim, a simulator for the
	MIPS architecture</p>
	</li><li><p>Write and execute some simple assembly language programs</p>
</li></ol>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Instructions</font></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p>These exercises are to be done individually.</p>
	</li><li><p>While you are encouraged to discuss with your colleagues, do
	not cross the fine line between discussion <i>to understand</i>
	versus discussion as a <i>short-cut</i> to complete your lab without
	really understanding.</p>
	</li><li><p>Create a directory called &lt;rollno&gt;-&lt;labno&gt;. Store
	all relevant files to this lab in that directory.</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>In the exercises, you will be asked various questions. Note
		down the answers to these in a file called “&lt;rollno&gt;-&lt;labno&gt;.txt”.</p>
		</li><li><p>In some parts of the exercises, you will have to show a demo
		to a TA; these are marked as such. The evaluation for each lab may
		be in the same lab, or in the subsequent lab, or during a time-slot
		agreed upon with the TAs. For this evaluation, you need to upload
		your code as well.</p>
		</li><li><p>While submitting (on bodhitree), you have to create a tar.gz
		or zip of the entire &lt;rollno&gt;-&lt;labno&gt; directory in
		which all your relevant files reside.</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li><p>Before leaving the lab, ensure the following:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>You have signed the attendance sheet</p>
		</li><li><p>You have uploaded your submission</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li><p>Things for you as a student to ensure, during evaluation by a
	TA of a particular lab submission:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>The TA has looked at your text file with the answers to
		various questions</p>
		</li><li><p>The TA has given you marks out of 10, and has entered it in
		the marks sheet, with his/her signature</p>
		</li><li><p>You have counter-signed the above-mentioned marks</p>
	</li></ol>

<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Starting
xspim</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.17in">Start xspim or qtspim by typing
	“xspim&amp;” or “qtspim&amp;” on a terminal.
	A window should pop-up.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-top: 0.17in">There are four parts on the
	screen. Note that you can scroll within each of the four parts,
	using the mouse.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-top: 0.17in">Note that this represents a
	simulated MIPS machine.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-top: 0.17in"><b>Question [1 mark]:</b> In the
	xspim/qtspim window, identify the various parts of the screen which
	you can understand; also identify the parts which you cannot
	understand (as yet).</p>
</li></ul>
<h3 class="western"><font color="#0000ff">Your first MIPS assembly
language program</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>For a MIPS assembly program, you need to specify a “text”
	section, which indicates a region in memory where the instructions
	are stored (recall the stored program concept)</p>
	</li><li><p>And for spim, you need to specify a “main” label,
	from which execution will begin</p>
	</li><li><p>Cut-paste the following lines into a file using a text
	editor; you can name the file anything, but we will assume below
	that you have named it “add.s”</p>
	<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">.text<br>main:<br># Your code starts from the line below</pre>
	</li><li><p>Write a program to add the integers 1 and 2; you can use the
	“li” or “load immediate” instruction, and
	any other appropriate instruction(s). Use appropriate registers for
	the instructions.</p>
	</li><li><p>Load the program in xspim using the load button. Identify
	your part of the program on the screen.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Question [0.5 marks]:</b> Identify the address at which
	your program begins. You can use the “print” “global
	symbols” button for this.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Question [0.5 marks]:</b> Is “li” really a
	MIPS instruction? Its a pseudo-instruction. What does it get
	translated into?</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Question [1 mark]:</b> Identify the machine code of your
	instructions. Identify the op-codes (higher order 6 bits of the
	machine code) of the various instructions in your assembly code.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Demo to TA [1 mark]:</b> Run the program by clicking the
	“run” button. Observe the result of your instructions to
	load/add in the appropriate register(s).</p>
</li></ul>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Stepping
through your program</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>You can step through your program one instruction at a time.
	To do this, first reload “add.s” using the “reload”
	button.</p>
	</li><li><p>Now step using the “step” button.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Demo to TA [1 mark]:</b> Show how you step through the
	instructions.</p>
</li></ul>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Using
breakpoints</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>You can step through small programs, but it gets cumbersome
	as the program gets big.</p>
	</li><li><p>You can use a “breakpoint” (or several
	breakpoints) in the program. A “breakpoint” is a point
	in the code where execution will temporarily stop, allowing you to
	examine the status of your program until that place. You can examine
	register contents or memory content, as appropriate.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Demo to TA [1 mark]:</b> After reloading “add.s”,
	set an appropriate breakpoint for your program, and demonstrate its
	usage to your TA. After encountering the breakpoint, step through
	the rest of the instructions one after another.</p>
</li></ul>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Using
the MIPS instruction set reference</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>You must learn to refer to and understand an instruction set
	reference. Look at the MIPS32 instruction set reference available on
	bodhitree.</p>
	</li><li><p>Change the “add.s” instruction to be able to load
	and add the following two 32-bit values: 0x20000001 and 0x10000002.
	You should not use any pseudo-instruction for this. You will have to
	find out how to load a 32-bit value onto a register. <i>Hint: you
	have to use two instructions for this.</i></p>
	</li><li><p><b>Demo to TA [1 mark]:</b> Show how you have modified
	“add.s” to now add two 32-bit values. Show a demo of the
	run on xspim/qtspim.</p>
</li></ul>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Your
first non-trivial assembly language program</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>So far you have learnt the usage of spim/xspim/qtspim, and to
	write a barebones assembly program. Now write a program to check,
	given two integers, if one is a multiple of the other<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
	Call your program “check-multiple.s”. You can assume
	that the first integer is in $s0 and the second integer is in $s1.
	The first two lines of your code should initialize $s0 and $s1. The
	rest of the code should work irrespective of the values of $s0 and
	$s1 (you can assume they are both positive non-zero integers).
	Finally, your code should set $s2 to 1 if one integer is a multiple
	of the other, 0 otherwise.<br></span></span><i>Hint-1: you will have
	to use the MIPS instruction reference for further relevant
	instructions to use, or simply subtract the smaller int from the
	larger in an appropriate while loop.<br>Hint-2: you may find it
	useful to first write the C or Java-code and then translate it
	</i><i><u>blindly</u></i> <i>to MIPS assembly code.</i></p>
