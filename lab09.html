<ol>
	<li><p>These exercises are to be done individually.</p>
	</li><li><p>While you are encouraged to discuss with your colleagues, do
	not cross the fine line between discussion <i>to understand</i>
	versus discussion as a <i>short-cut</i> to complete your lab without
	really understanding.</p>
	</li><li><p>Create a directory called &lt;rollno&gt;-&lt;labno&gt;. Store
	all relevant files to this lab in that directory.</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>In the exercises, you will be asked various questions. Note
		down the answers to these in a file called “lab09-answers.txt”.</p>
		</li><li><p>In some parts of the exercises, you will have to show a demo
		to a TA; these are marked as such. The evaluation for each lab will
		be in the subsequent lab, or during a time-slot agreed upon with
		the TAs. For this evaluation, you need to upload your code as well.</p>
		</li><li><p>While submitting (on BodhiTree), you have to create a tar.gz
		or zip of the entire &lt;rollno&gt;-&lt;labno&gt; directory in
		which all your relevant files reside.</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li><p>Before leaving the lab, ensure the following:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>You have signed the attendance sheet</p>
		</li><li><p>You have uploaded your submission</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li><p>Things to ensure during TA evaluation of a particular lab

<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Effect
of memory hierarchy on the performance of matrix multiplication</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Read the
	'pitfall' mentioned in page 551 of the textbook (3<sup>rd</sup>
	edition). This talks about the effect of the memory hierarchy on
	something similar to a matrix multiplication algorithm.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">In this
	exercise, you have to first implement a regular 3-nested-loop matrix
	multiplication algorithm in C-language. Write a file called
	'mat-mult.cc'. The program should declare 3 static 2-D arrays of
	type 'double'. Call these arrays A, B, and C. Use a '#define' for
	the SIZE of the 2D square arrays.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">A is
	initialized to the zero matrix, B to 2I (twice the identity matrix),
	and C to a matrix whose first row is [0, 1, 2, ..., SIZE-1] and all
	other rows are 0.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Within the
	'main' of the program, write the 3-nested-loop matrix multiplication
	algorithm. The heart of the loop will be something like:<br>A[i][j]
	= A[i][j] + B[i][k]*C[k][j]</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">In this
	loop, A and B are accessed row-wise, while C is accessed
	column-wise. Now, C-language allocates memory in row-major order
	(i.e. one row after another). So column-wise array access has little
	locality of reference, while row-wise access has good locality of
	reference.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Compile the
	program and run it, for SIZE=500. Estimate the time taken to run it,
	using the 'time' command. Run it 5 times and take the median value
	as the run-time.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">You are now
	going to make the program more efficient by first computing another
	matrix D, which is the transpose of the C matrix, to take advantage
	of locality of array access. Note that you will still be computing
	A=B*C, but will use the fact that transpose(transpose(D)) = C.</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Demo to
	TA [3 marks]:</b> Make the modification as suggested above, and save
	it in a file called 'mat-mult-opt.cc'. Compile and run the modified
	program 'mat-mult-opt.cc'. Compute the median run time of 5 runs, as
	earlier. Compare the run-time with the earlier run-time. Do you get
	a 'feel' for the effect of caches on your program's performance?</p>

<font color="#0000ff">Confirming the effect of the memory hierarchy,
using dineroIV</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><font color="#000000">In
	this exercise, you are going to produce (an approximate) dineroIV
	trace file of the execution of 'mat-mult.cc' and 'mat-mult-opt.cc'.
	We are going to ignore all instruction references (i.e. only deal
	with a D-cache), and also ignore all data references other than the
	4 arrays: A, B, C, and D (i.e. ignore i, j, k).</font></p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><font color="#000000">Modify
	both programs ('mat-mult.cc' and 'mat-mult-opt.cc') to make them
	print the <i>addresses</i> of the data they refer during their
	execution. Print in a format which can be understood by 'dineroIV'.
	Take care to print both reads as well as writes. (You can assume the
	specific manner of C-language expression evaluation; it is quite
	obvious).</font></p>
	</li><li><p><font color="#000000"><i>IMPORTANT NOTE-1: Do NOT print the
	output to a file, it would be too huge. You have to redirect the
	output of your program to dineroIV directly using a UNIX pipe.</i></font></p>
	</li><li><p><font color="#000000"><i>IMPORTANT NOTE-2: Change the SIZE of
	the array to 100x100 (from 500x500 earlier), else your simulation
	will run for very long.</i></font></p>
	</li><li><p><font color="#000000"><i>Hint: You may want to print the
	index of the outer most loop 'i' for each iteration. This is so that
	you know that your program is making progress. Note that you have to
	print to STDERR so that the input to dineroIV is not affected.</i></font></p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><font color="#000000"><b>Demo
	to TA [3 marks]:</b> Run the modified programs. Get the output file
	and feed it as input to 'dineroIV' with the following configuration:
	16-word blocks, 128KB data cache size, direct-mapped, write-back
	with write-allocate. Are you able to bolster your observations
	regarding program performance from the previous exercise?</font></p>

<h3 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; page-break-after: avoid">
<font color="#0000ff">Writing a program to guess the size of the
cache</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; page-break-after: avoid">
	<font color="#000000">In this exercise, you will write a clever
	program which will try to guess the size of the machine's cache. The
	idea is as follows. Declare a large array and access its elements.
	Compute the average access time. Once the size of the array exceeds
	the cache size, you will see a significant jump in the average
	access time (due to the miss penalty). With this, you can guess the
	cache size.</font></p>
	</li><li><p><font color="#000000"><i>Hints: In my solution, I used an int
	array. I had to arrange to access elements such that there was no
	spatial locality. This I did by accessing elements 97 words away
	from one another (and using %guess_size to arrange wrap-around). I
	multiplied guess_size by 2 each time. I also had to adjust the
	averaging loop somewhere between 100 and 10000, depending on the
	guess_size. With this arrangement, I was able to guess the L2 cache
	size. Other similar solutions may work for you.</i></font></p>
	</li><li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><font color="#000000">You
	may have to use the function gettimeofday() to do time measurements
	within your program.</font></p>
	</li><li><p><font color="#000000"><i><b>WARNING-1:</b> make sure to print
	anything <span style="text-decoration: none"><b>after</b></span> you
	have done all time computations necessary. This is because printing
	itself takes a very long time (several milli-seconds) and will
	disrupt any time measurements you may make within your program if
	you print anything inbetween.</i></font></p>
	</li><li><p><font color="#000000"><i><b>WARNING-2:</b> you need to pay
	careful attention to the types of various variables: int, long,
	float, double, etc. This could be a source of bug in this program.</i></font></p>
	</li><li><p><font color="#000000"><i><b>WARNING-3:</b> This is a tough
	problem. I had a tough time working out the hints/warnings I have
	given above. Hopefully with the hints it would be easier for you.
	But in any case, try this problem last.</i></font></p>

	studies comparing the performance of radix sort with that of
	quick-sort. Implement both sorting algorithms and generate graphs
	similar to that in the textbook. Use the dineroIV cache simulator as
	necessary, in a manner similar to how we have used it above. You
	will get upto 20 house points, depending on the level of clarity in
	what you show.</p>
