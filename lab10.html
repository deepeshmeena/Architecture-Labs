<h3 class="western"><font color="#0000ff">Goals</font></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Writing a
	program to guess the hard-disk or pen-drive sector size</p>
</li></ol>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Instructions</font></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p>These exercises are to be done in <b>groups of two students</b>.</p>
	</li><li><p>While you are encouraged to discuss with your colleagues, do
	not cross the fine line between discussion <i>to understand</i>
	versus discussion as a <i>short-cut</i> to complete your lab without
	really understanding</p>
	</li><li><p>In the exercises, you will be asked various questions. Note
	down the answers to these in a file called “lab10-answers.txt”.</p>
	</li><li><p>In some parts of the exercises, you will have to show a demo
	to a TA; these are marked as such.</p>
	</li><li><p>Before leaving the lab, ensure the following:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>The TA has looked at all the relevant demos</p>
		</li><li><p>The TA has looked at your text file with the answers to
		various questions</p>
		</li><li><p>The TA has given you marks out of 10, and has entered it in
		the marks sheet, with his/her signature</p>
		</li><li><p>You have counter-signed the above-mentioned marks</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li><p>You have to use the MIPS conventions, unless mentioned
	otherwise.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>House points:</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">Some
	questions carry house points. For these, you are allowed to work
	along with others, but only if </span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">all</span></i>
	<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">of
	those working together have completed the lab and shown it to the
	TA. (You can work on it individually, even before finishing the lab
	completely, but only if you care about house points more than your
	own marks!). All questions related to house points have to be shown
	to the instructor (Bhaskar).</span></span></span></p>
</li></ol>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Guessing
the hard-disk/pen-drive sector size</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Question [0 marks]:</b> Write the names of both lab
	partners in the answers file.</p>
	</li><li><p>You are to write a program guess-sector-size.c which will
	guess your hard-disk or pen-drive sector size.  Your program should
	depend on analysis of time taken to read a certain quantity of
	information in a certain pattern.</p>
	</li><li><p>For this exercise, you have to use the hard-drive or
	pen-drive's raw device, which would be something like “/dev/sda”
	or “/dev/sdb” or “/dev/hda”.  You can find out which, by
	using the 'mount' command.</p>
	</li><li><p>You will need sudo or root access to run the program to read
	the raw device (normal user programs have to go through the OS's
	file system abstraction).</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Demo to TA [1 mark]:</b> Find out the name of your raw
	device and show how you found this out, in the demo.</p>
	</li><li><p><font color="#ff0000"><b>WARNING:</b></font> Make sure you do
	only <b>READ</b>, and not write.  Do NOT use any writing related
	system calls.  If you end up writing, <font color="#ff0000">you can
	damage your hard disk file system permanently</font>.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Question [0 marks]:</b> Have you checked that there is no
	“write” command in your program? How did you check this?</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Question [1 mark]:</b> The OS has a cache of disk sectors
	read.  The time taken for a read will be near-zero if the requested
	item is in the cache.  So find out how to clear this OS cache.  For
	clearing the cache too, you will need sudo/root access.</p>
	</li><li><p>Run the code on your laptop or PC, using the default
	hard-disk or any other hard disk or pen drive.  Take care to clear
	the OS cache as necessary before running.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Question [1+1=2 marks]:</b> Plot a graph of the relevant
	read-latency metric against a chosen parameter.  Plot also another
	line in the same graph in the case where the OS cache plays a role.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Demo to TA [5 marks]:</b> Explain the shape of the graph
	and deduce the sector size from the graph shape.</p>
	</li><li><p><b>Demo to TA [1 mark]:</b> Figure out how to use the fdisk
	command to find out the sector size of your hard-drive or pen drive.
	 Show the use of this command in the demo.</p>
</li></ul>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Hints
for writing the guessing program</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>You can guess the sector size in powers of 2, and assume a
	max possible sector size like 1MB or so.</p>
	</li><li><p>The key observation is that the hard-disk (or pen drive) is
	read in units of sectors, even if the program wants to read lesser
	amounts.  And once a sector is read, its contents are available in
	the cache immediately after.</p>
	</li><li><p>And, if some bytes are available in the cache, the latency to
	read that is negligible compared to the latency of reading bytes not
	in the cache.</p>
	</li><li><p>In your program, you have to use the above facts to design an
	appropriate reading latency metric which will show a large
	difference between guesses which are smaller than the actual sector
	size.</p>
	</li><li><p>Do not forget to take average or median over a sufficient
	number of readings, to tide over random other latency effects in the
	system.</p>
</li></ul>
